# UCD-VIRT-FSF-PT-06-2023-U-LOL Bootcamp Class Repository

Welcome to your UCD Full Stack Web Development class repository (Summer 2023).

Class Instructor: John Young (jyoung@instructors.2u.com)

## How to use

As you will learn, web developers and coders in general work together as a team through a **version control system**. The most popular one is called `git`. Our class will use a `git` **repository** ("repo") for short to distribute class materials.

This is a one-way repository, i.e., you only pull content from it. You will never need to push content. This is your reference material, not where you turn in your homework.

Before each class, make sure you perform a `git pull` to get the latest class material.

## What is a `README.md`?

This document is an example of what each code project should have: an introduction that summarizes what is in the project, why it may be useful to a developer, and how to install and use it. `README.md` documents are written in a light weight markup language called Markdown. It give us a set of limited styles defined by a simple syntax to make our documents easier to read.

## Contents

The repository has one directory for each week of class. We will be spending a lot of time in these folders. Each week is mostly structured as follows:

- `README.md`: Each week has a `README` describing the week's content. A great pre-read for the week, this file outlines learning objectives and ways to assess your understanding.
- `day_1_agenda.md, day_2_agenda.md, day_3_agenda.md`: Each day I will keep track of what we did in class. This will help you navigate the content in the class videos. I will also give suggestions on how to study before the next class
- `pre-read.md`: I will prepare a pre-read list for each day of the week. This is not required but reading a few web pages before class will help soften the blow one feels when learning a new topic
- `01-Activities`: These are in-class activities. This is where you apply what is discussed in class lectures. Generally, we go through all of the activities but some are left as supplemental. Activities incorporate concepts required to complete that week's homework. Some activities are just demonstration, others are `Unsolved` exercises that you complete during class. After attempting an activity in class, the instructor will provide a `Solved` version for your review. Activities are hard. It is in your interest to review them again after class. **HINT:** Activities usually provide code that is useful to complete homeworks.
- `02-Challenge`: This is the homework for the week. It is typically assigned the first class of the week and due the same day the follwing week. For example, if a week starts on Tuesday, the assignment is due the following Tuesday. Each homework will have a `README.md` describing the requirements for completion. There is a separate grading rubric that we will sometimes share with you if we feel it helps communicate the requirements. Sometimes a homework assignment has starter code, sometimes it doesn't. If it has starter code it will be in a `Develop` folder. When you start a homework project, please take the starter code out of the provided `Develop` folder and put it in the root of your homework's `git` project.
- `03-Algorithims`: Starting in week 3, we will provide you with code puzzles. These are not directly addressed in class, but they are a useful practice of the Javascript language and problem solving.
- `04-Slides`: Any slides shown during class will be offered here
- `05-Important`: Some weeks introduce a new skill that requires some extra material (e.g., installing `mysql` or deploying to `heroku`). The `Important` folder will supply a how-to guide you can refer back to.

I have also created an `_extras` folder for supplemental content
